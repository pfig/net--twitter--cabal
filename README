Net::Twitter::Cabal

You have a Twitter stream than can be updated by several people. Dealing with
authorisations is painful, and there's no way to identify a poster.

Net::Twitter::Cabal let's you manage this stream from a central point, where
you have full control of who can post and without the need to distribute the account's credentials.

You need a Jabber account for the receiver, and everyone involved must have an account on a Jabber network* (e.g., a GMail account will work, via Google Talk). You then tell the participants the name (but not the password!) of the receiver's Jabber account (the JID) and once they add it to their friends list, they're ready to rock.

* In the future I might add a plugin mechanism to make it easy to support
  other types of transport.
